# Database server

Today we will practice a tech test to demonstrate your understanding of web technologies. This is an actual tech test that was given to one of our coaches when they applied for a dev role.

Bear in mind that most tech tests do not have a set timeframe. Although we do have a "soft" time limit, imposed mainly by the structure of the week, we are not expecting you to finish within the day - so take your time and focus on writing the best code you can produce.

## The brief

You receive a message from a prospective employer:

- Write a program that runs a server that is accessible on `http://localhost:4000/

- When your server receives a request on `/set?somekey=somevalue` it should store the passed key and value in memory.

- When it receives a request on `/get?key=somekey` it should return the value stored at `somekey`.
